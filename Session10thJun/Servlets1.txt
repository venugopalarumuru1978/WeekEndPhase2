What is an Servlet?

Servlets is an web technology which meant for developing server side web applications. 

What is a Web Server?

it is an application which takes request from the client and provides responses to the clients.

Request :- the information which are sending to the server from the client
Response :-  the information which are getting from the server to the client

Apache Tomcat
Web Logic
GlassFish

Usually, we will have Apache Tomcat
Every Server having a name and portnumber

if server is configured in local system, the server name is "Localhost" and default port number is 8080, if required we can change it. 

Port number is a number which meant for identifing an application on  server. 

http://localhost:8081/WebApp1/Page1.html

Servlet is an API which provides collection of interfaces and classes. 


Every Request will process based on a protocal, 

http := hypertext transfer protocal is meant for viewing pages /info from the server. 
https :-  it is as same as http with security.

Once servlet is created, we have to add servlet-api.jar, it is located in tomcat server lib folder. 

Html Pages are used to design the page whereas servlet pages are used to write functionality of the page. 
---------------------------
How to execute Servlet with Html Page:- 

1.  Create servlet and code it as per the requirement. 
2.  Create html page then add <form> tag with "submit" button
	<form  method="POST/GET"  action="servletname">
		<input type="submit"  value="Click Me" />
	</form>
3.  Run html page then click button to get servlet output. 

As per the html,  there are 3 buttons
1.  button :-  to execute only script
2.  reset  :- to reload page
3.  submit :- to submit the page to the server along with data. 

POST :- this method is used while submitting page to the server.
GET :-  this method is used while retriving any content from the server.
