Cookie  <object> = new Cookie(cookiname, value)

To add cookie to the browser

How to read info from cookies
		Actually Cookies are exist in browser in the form of array. 
			Cookie  <object>[] =  request.getCookies() :-  to get all cookies

	getName() :-  to get name of cookie
	getValue() :- to get value of cookie
