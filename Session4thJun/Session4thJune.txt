Hibernate Mappings 
----------------

What is a meant by mapping:-
	It is the process of relationship b/w classes. 

There are 4 relationships are exist

1.  One to One
		One Entity mapped with another single entity.
			Ex:-  An Employee mapped with An Address
				An Student mapped with a course 
2.  One to Many 
		One Entity mapped wtih multiple enttities
			Ex:-   A Department mapped with multiple employees.
			       A course mapped with multiple students.
			       A Question mapped with multiple answers.
3.  Many to One
		Many Entities are mapped with One Entity.
			Ex:-   Multiple Vechiles are mapped with one Owner(Person).
4.  Many to Many
		Many Entities  are mapped with Many Entities
			Ex:-  Multiple Students are mapped with Multiple Courses. 
Student Process:-
-----------------
1. Biodata
		RollNumber	StudentName	Gender		Address		Location	
2. Marks
		Sno	Exam	Sub1	Sub2	Total	  Average      RollNumber
3. Attendance
		Sno	Month	WorkedDays	PresentDays	AbsentDays	RollNumber

While working with these mappings, there are two types of directions
1. Uni-Directional
		One Way
2. Bi-Directional
		Two Way
