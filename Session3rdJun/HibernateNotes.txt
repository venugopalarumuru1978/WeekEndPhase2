JDBC Limitations :- 
----------------------

1.  Jdbc is a Database Dependent, if we change sql software from mysql to others, we need to change 	coding of queries if required. 
2.  Developer should have SQL Knowledge to develop the application. 

What is an Hibernate?
It is an Framework is used to communicate with databases.
It is a ORM Tool(Object Relational Mapping Tool), which makes developer task easier to communicate with any Database. 

ORM Tool is a Tool which allows to develop an  application without using any sql queries. 

SessionFactory is a collection of Session Objects. 
It includes connection information of the database. 

Session :-  This class is used to communicate with database for  Data Operations. 
		Data Creation, Manipulating, Accessing 

	save() :-  this method is used to create table and stores object data into table. 

Transaction :-  This class is required to perform DML Operations(Insert/Update/Delete). 
whenever session object performs any dml operation, to save/cancel that operation  Transaction is used.

To Work with Hibernate fw, we have to download collection related jar files. 
---------------------------------------
To Retrive Any Data from db tables using Hibernate, we have to use HQL(Hibernate Query Lang)

SQL :- SELECT * FROM studentinfo;

HQL :-  from Student;  // Student is a Classname

SQL :- Select * from studentinfo where rollno=101;

HQL :-  from Student where rollno=101;

how to pass arguments to the hql query

session.CreateQuery("from Student where rollno=:variable")
qryObj.setParameter("variable", value)

SQL :-  Delete from studentinfo where rollno=101;

HQL :-  Delete from student where rollno=101;

SQL :-  Update studentinfo set  std_name=value where rollno=101;

HQL :-  Update student set  sname=value where rollno=101;
 
For Update and Delete in HQL, executeUpdate() method is used.

 
TypedQuery is the class which any hql query(select/update/delete/....).
--------------------------

Persistance class can be mapped in two ways
1. By using XML
2. By using Annotations

Java Annotation is a tag that represents the metadata i.e. attached with class, interface, methods or fields to indicate some additional information which can be used by java compiler and JVM.

Annotations in Java are used to provide additional information, so it is an alternative option for XML.

Annotations in Hibernate:-
@Entity  :-  It is used to tell that class should convert into table. 
@Table(name="tablename") :-   table name in database. 
@Id  :-  which tells that primary key.
@GeneratedValue :-  which tells that auto-increment value for a column.
@Column(name="colname") :-  which tells that column in database.
